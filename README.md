<h2>About</h2>
<p>My first application developed during my full-stack developer training. Now more modern than before ðŸ™‚. This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”a classic favorite that never gets old. You can either play it online or clone the code to run it in your preferred IDE."</p>
